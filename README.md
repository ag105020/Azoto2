For plotting, download all the files and put them in the same folder. The codes are in python 3 and they require Latex and pylab. 

1. Plotting FIG 1: 
Run Fig1.py

2. Plotting FIG 2: 
Run Fig2.py

3. Plotting FIG 4: 
Run Fig4_calculation.py and then run Fig4_plot.py. To change oxygen concentration, change values of O2satratio in Fig4_calculation.py and O2p in Fig4_plot.py. O2p must be 100 x O2satratio. To change resolution, alter values in tune CNstep and Ninstep in Fig4_calculation.py. 

4. Plotting FIG 5:
Run Fig5.py

5. Plotting FIG S1: 
Run FigS1.py. To change oxygen concentration, change a value of O2satratio. Resolution can be changed in the same way as FIG 4.

6. Plotting FIG S2:
Run FigS2.py. To change resolution, alter values of Ninnstep and O2satratiostep.
